# Pindar Horace Hordar
## (An Ode-Gym)

A [word-gym](https://www.kylebooten.me/progym.html) that furnishes the poet with instructions for writing an ode, either Pindaric, Horatian, or (rarely) a blend of the two.  

My code consists of [grammar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbooten/pindar_horace_hordar/main/pindar_horace_hordar.txt) that is design to generate text  with (and only with) Nick Montfort's small-scale text-generative platform ["Gram's Fairy Tales"](https://taper.badquar.to/12/grams_fairy_tales.html).
